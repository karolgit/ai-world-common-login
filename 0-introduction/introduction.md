# Get Started – Cloud Login

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, offering deployment options that range from the public cloud to your own data center. With best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Oracle Cloud helps organizations innovate faster and operate more securely.

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

### Types of Cloud Accounts

There are two types of cloud accounts you may receive:

- **Free Tier Accounts**  
  After signing up for the free [Oracle Cloud promotion](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com) or for a paid account, you will receive a welcome email. This email includes your cloud account details and sign-in credentials.

- **Paid Oracle Cloud Accounts**  
  When your tenancy is provisioned, Oracle sends a welcome email to the default administrator at your company. This administrator can then create users for each person who needs access to Oracle Cloud. Check your email or contact your administrator for your credentials and account name.

The cloud accounts for the workshop may be provided either by LiveLab platform or directly by the event organizer:

- **Sandbox Cloud Accounts - From LiveLab**  
  Sandbox accounts are temporary environments used in workshops, training, or Oracle LiveLabs. These accounts allow you to safely explore Oracle Cloud features in a pre-configured environment without affecting production workloads. Login details are usually provided directly by the LiveLab platform.

- **Cloud Accounts - Created By Event Organizer**  
  Sometimes a single Oracle Cloud tenancy is provisioned for an event, and multiple user accounts or identity domains are created under it. Event organizers or instructors share the login credentials with participants. Access, roles, and services are centrally managed but isolated per user to ensure a smooth hands-on experience.
